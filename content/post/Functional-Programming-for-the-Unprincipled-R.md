## Additional Resources

1. Much thanks to Alvin Alexander and his excellent book [Functional Programming Simplified][1] where I first saw someone make the [connection between Unix pipelines and FP][2].
2. For another more detailed description of what functional programming as a data flow transformation pipeline means, and the advantages of this paradigm, you can and should read [this excellent piece][3] by Li Haoyi.
